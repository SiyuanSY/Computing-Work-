# Computing-Work
Dear Ms Low,
  You told us that future dummanians are going to be MPs, but Ms low aren't you a teacher teaching us right now. You tell us no ark no mark, this one that one everything is hot favourite, one fraction on the left one on the right, y = mx + c, no working no mark, I must buck up ah! Ms low, not to scare you ah... but I really cannot memorise everything! I know u can see whether I have Math talent, but sadly I don't, you told us year 1 don't sleep so late ah, but u give us so much homework how we finish by 12 pm? if u ask later next time I get married then how ah? I will say:" I'm not getting married like how Tristan did with a wife in Hongkong and travel to SG with SGD$6000 in their pocket." U said yall better stop on your what star brawls? But I don't play Brawl Stars Ms low. 
  Although u have been nagging and nagging at us for the past 9 months, I know u said all these for the sake of us. Although we might not be future MPs, but we will try our best in our exams and A-Levels. I will not let your Hot Favourites' marks go to waste, I will draw arcs, and I will definitely give all my workings and also not lose marks from the PAU.
